## Objective

Can a machine distinguish an underwater sea **mine** from a **rock** using only reflected
sound? A sonar device pings the seabed and records the energy reflected back across 60
frequency bands. To the eye, mine and rock returns look nearly identical. This project
builds an end-to-end classification pipeline that makes the distinction automatically:

1. **Compare** four candidate models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Neural Net).
2. **Tune** the winning Extra Trees classifier via randomized search on ROC-AUC.
3. **Interpret** the model with permutation feature importance.

All logic lives in an importable package (`src/sonar_detection/`); a single reproducible
notebook (`notebooks/sonar_analysis.ipynb`) tells the story end to end.

## Dataset

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | [UCI ML Repository #151](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks) (https://doi.org/10.24432/C5J619) |
| Samples | 208 sonar returns |
| Features | 60 frequency-band energy readings (`freq_1` … `freq_60`), each in [0, 1] |
| Target | Binary — `M` (mine) = 111, `R` (rock) = 97 |

The dataset is tiny, so the labeled CSV is committed directly as `data/sonar.csv` — no
download required for the notebook or CI. See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for the
schema and regeneration steps.

## Methods

- **Supervised learning:** Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and a small
  Neural Network (`MLPClassifier`), all via scikit-learn.
- **Preprocessing:** target encoding (`M`→1, `R`→0), stratified train/test split, standard scaling.
- **Model selection:** stratified 5-fold cross-validation scored on ROC-AUC.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** randomized search over Extra Trees parameters (`tune_extra_trees`).
- **Evaluation:** accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1.
- **Interpretability:** permutation feature importance (mean AUC drop over 30 shuffles).
- **Visualization:** interactive Plotly charts in the notebook.

## Results

Model comparison, ranked by 5-fold cross-validated ROC-AUC (the reliable metric given the
42-sample test set):

| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | CV AUC | F1 (Mine) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Extra Trees** | **0.929** | **0.982** | **0.940** | **0.933** |
| Neural Net | 0.881 | 0.952 | 0.907 | 0.889 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.857 | 0.925 | 0.914 | 0.864 |
| Random Forest | 0.833 | 0.924 | 0.908 | 0.844 |

The tuned Extra Trees model reaches **~0.944 cross-validated ROC-AUC**. The most
discriminative frequency bands are `freq_37`, `freq_45`, `freq_27`, `freq_12`, and `freq_11`.

## Live Demo

**[Try the app →](https://sonar-mine-detection-andrew-assile.streamlit.app/)**

An interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app (`app.py`) wraps the tuned model —
generate synthetic mine/rock-like signals or hand-tune all 60 frequency bands, then
inspect the prediction, a confidence gauge, the signal energy profile against class
means, and a per-band contribution breakdown.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app trains the model on first load (cached) from `data/sonar.csv` — no external
services or pre-trained artifacts required.

Deployed on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) from this repo
(branch `master`, main file `app.py`); dependencies install from `requirements.txt`.

> ⚠️ The held-out test set is only 42 samples, so cross-validation metrics are the more
> reliable estimate of generalization. In an operational setting this model would act as a
> **first-pass filter** on sonar returns — narrowing the set that needs expert review, not
> making standalone safety-critical decisions.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/aassile/Sonar_Mine_Detection.git
cd Sonar_Mine_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# 2. Run the full pipeline in one call
python -c "from sonar_detection import run_pipeline; \
    r = run_pipeline('data/sonar.csv'); print(r['comparison'].round(4))"

# 3. Or open the reproducible notebook
jupyter lab notebooks/sonar_analysis.ipynb
```

Using the package directly:

```python
from sonar_detection import (
    load_sonar, encode_target, split_features_target,
    train_test_split_sonar, scale_features, build_extra_trees, evaluate_model,
)

df = encode_target(load_sonar("data/sonar.csv"))
X, y = split_features_target(df)
X_tr, X_te, y_tr, y_te = train_test_split_sonar(X, y)
X_tr, X_te, scaler = scale_features(X_tr, X_te)

model = build_extra_trees().fit(X_tr, y_tr)
print(evaluate_model(model, X_te, y_te))
```

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The suite covers data loading, preprocessing, model construction/tuning, evaluation
metrics, and the end-to-end pipeline using synthetic fixtures (no dataset download needed).
CI runs lint (ruff), tests on Python 3.10 & 3.11, and executes the notebook on every push.
